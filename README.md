# app-projects

Implementing simple projects from [lorinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) in various languages.

## Tiers

[lorinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas#projects) uses a 3-tier system. There are `beginner`, `intermediate` and `advanced` tiers. Each project belongs to one of them.

## Format

Each project will be at the base of this repository, in the folder `<tier>_<project>/`. Optionally, if a project is implemented in multiple languages, it will be in a folder `<tier>_<project>_<language>/`.

### Example: Beginner project: Bin2Dec

The *Bin2Dec* project is very simple, and thus needs no subfolders. The `README.md` will store a description of the project. It will either be written by me or it will be from the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo.

## Contributing

Right now I am only working on these for personal practice with git. I may (and probably will) accept pull requests at some point. If you want to contribute, feel free to send me a pull request, which might be put on hold until this repo is ready for collaboration.
